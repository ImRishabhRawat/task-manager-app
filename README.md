- Database: MySQL

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start building your task manager website:

1. **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Begin by learning the basics of JavaScript if you're not already familiar.

2. **React.js:** Dive into React.js by reading the official documentation and completing React tutorials and courses.

3. **Java Basics:** If you're new to Java, learn the fundamentals of the language.

4. **Spring Boot:** Explore Spring Boot by following official guides and tutorials.

5. **Database Setup:** Install MySQL and create a new database for your application.

## Project Structure

Your project directory structure should look something like this:



```plaintext
task-manager/
├── backend/ # Spring Boot Backend
├── frontend/ # React.js Frontend
├── database/ # Database Setup Scripts
├── README.md # Project Documentation


## Front-end Development with React

1. Set up a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Create components for sections, tasks, and timetable.
3. Build the user interface for adding, updating, and deleting sections and tasks.
4. Implement user authentication and login functionality.
5. Create routing for different pages (e.g., section task lists, timetable).
6. Fetch and display data from the Spring Boot backend using API calls.

## Back-end Development with Spring Boot

1. Create a new Spring Boot project.
2. Set up the project structure and dependencies.
3. Configure Spring Data JPA for database access.
4. Create entities for sections, tasks, timetables, and users.
5. Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on sections, tasks, and timetables.
6. Configure Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.

## Database Setup

1. Set up your MySQL database.
2. Create tables for sections, tasks, timetables, and users using SQL scripts.
3. Configure the Spring Boot application to connect to the database.

## Authentication and Security

1. Implement user registration and login functionality.
2. Secure API endpoints to protect user data and restrict access.
3. Implement data validation and error handling to ensure application security.

## Timetable Functionality

1. Design and implement the timetable feature.
2. Create API endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving timetable data.
3. Develop the notification system for sending reminders based on the user's timetable.

## Deployment

1. Deploy your React.js front end and Spring Boot back end to a web server or cloud platform.
2. Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
3. Ensure secure deployment practices and monitor your application in production.
